# Vim Roguelike Challenge (aka VimRC)

An old-school roguelike inspired by the best text editor.  Explore dungeons using powerful navigation commands, yank awesome loot, and delete enemies like the enigmatic `ed` and the dreaded `Emacs` in your quest to do the impossible: exiting the Very Intimidating Maze (vim).

Made for the 7 Day Roguelike Challenge.

Engine architecture largely copied from [this tutorial.](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/)  (If it ain't broke, don't fix it.)
